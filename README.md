# React Tailwind CSS Modal Project


## Main Technologies and Frameworks

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Vite**: A fast build tool for modern web applications.
- **ESLint**: A tool for identifying and reporting on patterns found in JavaScript code.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces.

## Codebase Organization

The codebase is organized as follows:

- The root directory contains configuration files such as `.eslintrc.cjs`, `.gitignore`, `package-lock.json`, `package.json`, `postcss.config.js`, `tailwind.config.js`, and `vite.config.js`.
- The `public` directory contains the `index.html` file and the `vite.svg` asset.
- The `src` directory contains the main source code of the application.
 - The `App.jsx` file is the entry point of the React application.
 - The `assets` directory contains the `react.svg` asset.
 - The `components` directory contains reusable React components such as `Button.jsx` and `Modal.jsx`.
 - The `index.css` file contains the global CSS styles for the application.
 - The `main.jsx` file is responsible for rendering the `App` component.

## Scripts

The `package.json` file specifies the project's dependencies and scripts. The main scripts are:

- `dev`: Starts the development server using Vite.
- `build`: Builds the production-ready version of the application.
- `lint`: Runs ESLint to check the code for any linting errors.
- `preview`: Starts a server to preview the production build.

## Dependencies

The dependencies include React, React DOM, and React Icons for the application's functionality. The devDependencies include various tools and plugins required for development, such as Vite, ESLint, Tailwind CSS, and PostCSS.
